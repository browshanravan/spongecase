# Welcome to sPoNgECasE
This streamlit app is meant to be a fun tool to change your words or sentences to spongecase.

## What is sponsecase?
[Spongecase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_caps), also known as studly caps, sticky caps, or alternating caps is a form of text notation in which the capitalisation of letters varies by some pattern, or arbitrarily.

## Getting started
You can pull this package and run it in devcontainers in your VSCode.

Otherwise run the app by installing `python 3.10` using conda.

The easiest way to run the app is to go to the local directory of this repo and execute:

```console
sh app.sh
```
